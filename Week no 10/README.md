### Project Overview/Planning

- In this project, we are creating a tool that estimates data science salaries `(MAE ~ $ 11K)` to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
- We will scraped over 1000 job descriptions from `glassdoor` using `python` and `selenium`
- After that, we will engineere the features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
- To optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
- At the end, we will built a client facing API using flask.
