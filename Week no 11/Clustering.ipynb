    "**Clustering** is a technique in machine learning that involves grouping similar objects together. The goal of clustering is to divide a large data set into smaller, more meaningful subgroups based on the similarity between the objects in the data set. This can help to identify patterns, relationships, and insights in the data that might not be easily visible when looking at the data in its raw form.\n",

    "**k-means** is a type of centroid-based clustering algorithm. In k-means, the data set is divided into k clusters, where k is a user-defined number. Each cluster is represented by its centroid, which is the mean of all the data points in the cluster. The algorithm assigns each data point to the closest centroid, and then updates the centroid based on the new cluster assignments. This process continues until the centroids stop changing or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",

    "## Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical clustering** is a type of clustering algorithm that creates a hierarchical representation of the data set. The hierarchical representation is called a dendrogram, and it is a tree-like structure that shows the relationships between the objects in the data set. In hierarchical clustering, the algorithm starts by treating each data point as a separate cluster. Then, the closest two clusters are merged into a single cluster, and the process continues until all the data points are combined into a single cluster. There are two main types of hierarchical clustering: Agglomerative and Divisive. In Agglomerative hierarchical clustering, the algorithm starts with individual data points and merges them into larger clusters. In Divisive hierarchical clustering, the algorithm starts with the entire data set and splits it into smaller clusters.\n",
