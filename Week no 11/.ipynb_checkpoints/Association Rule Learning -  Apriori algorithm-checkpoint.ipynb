    "## Association Rule Learning : Apriori algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Association Rule Learning** is a data mining technique that is used to uncover hidden relationships among variables in large datasets. The goal of Association Rule Learning is to find relationships between items in a dataset that occur frequently and in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apriori algorithm** is a popular algorithm used in Association Rule Learning to discover association rules in transactional databases. It uses a \"bottom-up\" approach to identify frequent itemsets and uses these frequent itemsets to generate association rules. The algorithm works by iteratively reducing the candidate itemsets until only the frequent itemsets are left. The Apriori algorithm has become a standard for Association Rule Learning and is widely used in fields such as market basket analysis, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.\n",
