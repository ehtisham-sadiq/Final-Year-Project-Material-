    "Feature scaling is a technique that is used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of a data set. In linear regression, it is important to scale the features because the scale of the variables can affect the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Scaling:\n",
    "   - If you have a problem with multiple features\n",
    "   - We should make sure those features have a similar scale. It means gradient descent will converge more quickly.\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "   - `x1` = size (0 - 2000 feet)\n",
    "   - `x2` = number of bedrooms (1-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "This type of data generated `contours` as below if we plot $\\theta_1 \\; vs.\\; \\theta_2$ give a very tall and thin shape due to the huge range difference. Running gradient descent on this kind of cost function can take a long time to find the global minimum.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/p34.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Without scaling, the feature x1 will dominate the model because its range is much larger than the range of x2. As a result, the model may be biased towards x1. To avoid this issue, it is recommended to scale the features so that they have a similar range. There are several ways to scale the features, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Min-Max scaling**: This method scales the features to a specific range (e.g., 0-1). The transformed values are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{scaled} = \\frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x_{scaled}$ is the transformed value, $x$ is the original value, $x_{min}$ is the minimum value of the feature, and $x_{max}$ is the maximum value of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Standardization**: This method scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The transformed values are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{scaled} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x_{scaled}$ is the transformed value, $x$ is the original value, $\\mu$ is the mean of the feature, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to get everything into -1 to +1 range (approximately). We want to avoid large ranges, small ranges or very different ranges from one another, for this purpose we use `mean normalization` or `standardization`. It is because `Standardization` is less sensitive to outliers because it is based on the `mean` and `standard deviation` of the feature, which are not influenced by extreme values as much as the minimum and maximum values. In contrast, `min-max` scaling is based on the minimum and maximum values of the feature, which can be affected by outliers. As a result, standardization is less likely to be affected by outliers than min-max scaling."

    "\n",
    "- **How to make sure gradient descent is working correctly.**\n",
    "- **How to choose learning rate $\\alpha$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Check the convergence of the cost function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to check the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm is to plot the cost function (e.g., mean squared error) over the number of iterations. If the cost function is decreasing over time and eventually reaches a minimum, then the algorithm is working correctly.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/p35.png\" height=300x width=300x>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Compare the model's performance with other algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare the performance of the gradient descent algorithm with other algorithms (e.g., least squares, normal equation) to see if the results are similar. If the results are significantly different, it may indicate an issue with the gradient descent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Monitor the learning rate:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the learning rate is too high, the gradient descent algorithm may diverge and never converge to a minimum. If the learning rate is too low, it may take a long time to converge. Monitoring the learning rate can help ensure that it is set to a reasonable value. If $\\alpha$ is too small,  slow convergence. If $\\alpha$ is too large, $J(\\theta)$ may not decrease on every iteration; may not converge. So to choose $\\alpha$, try different values like 0.0001, 0.001, 0.1, 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/p36.png\" height=300px width=300px>\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Check the initialization of the weights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialization of the weights can also affect the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm. If the weights are initialized to extreme values, the algorithm may converge slowly or not at all. It is generally a good idea to initialize the weights to small random values."

    "### Polynomial Regression\n",
    "Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial. The Polynomial Regression equation is given below:<br>\n",

    "    <li>\n",
    "It is also called the special case of Multiple Linear Regression in ML. Because we add some polynomial terms to the Multiple Linear regression equation to convert it into Polynomial Regression.<br>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "It is a linear model with some modification in order to increase the accuracy.<br>\n",

    "    <li>\n",
    "The dataset used in Polynomial regression for training is of non-linear nature.<br>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "It makes use of a linear regression model to fit the complicated and non-linear functions and datasets.<br>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "Hence, \"In Polynomial regression, the original features are converted into Polynomial features of required degree (2,3,..,n) and then modeled using a linear model.\"\n",
    "    </li>\n",

    "####  Need for polynomial regression:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "If we apply a linear model on a linear dataset, then it provides us a good result as we have seen in Simple Linear Regression, but if we apply the same model without any modification on a non-linear dataset, then it will produce a drastic output. Due to which loss function will increase, the error rate will be high, and accuracy will be decreased.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "So for such cases, where data points are arranged in a non-linear fashion, we need the Polynomial Regression model. We can understand it in a better way using the below comparison diagram of the linear dataset and non-linear dataset.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "In the above image, we have taken a dataset which is arranged non-linearly. So if we try to cover it with a linear model, then we can clearly see that it hardly covers any data point. On the other hand, a curve is suitable to cover most of the data points, which is of the Polynomial model.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "Hence, if the datasets are arranged in a non-linear fashion, then we should use the Polynomial Regression model instead of Simple Linear Regression.\n",

    "Polynomial Regression is generally used when the points in the data are not captured by the Linear Regression Model and the Linear Regression fails in describing the best result clearly.\n",
