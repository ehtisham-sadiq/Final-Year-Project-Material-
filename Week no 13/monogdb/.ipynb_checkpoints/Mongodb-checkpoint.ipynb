    "## What is MongoDB?\n",
    "- MongoDB is a **document-oriented** NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. \n",
    "- Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of **collections** and **documents**. \n",
    "- Documents consist of **key-value pairs** which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. \n",
    "- Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables, contain document sets.\n",
    "- MongoDB offers support for many programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Go, Java, **Python**, Ruby and Swift.\n",

    "## MongoDB history\n",
    "MongoDB was created by **Dwight Merriman and Eliot Horowitz**, who encountered development and scalability issues with traditional relational database approaches while building web applications at DoubleClick, an online advertising company that is now owned by Google Inc. The name of the database was derived from the word humongous to represent the idea of supporting large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merriman and Horowitz helped form **10Gen Inc**. in 2007 to commercialize MongoDB and related software. The company was renamed **MongoDB Inc**. in 2013 and went public in October 2017 under the ticker symbol MDB.The DBMS was released as **open source software** in 2009 and has been kept updated since.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organizations like the insurance company MetLife have used MongoDB for customer service applications\n",
    "- While other websites like Craigslist have used it for archiving data. \n",
    "- The CERN physics lab has used it for data aggregation and discovery. \n",
    "- Additionally, The New York Times has used MongoDB to support a form-building application for photo submissions."

    "## Key Components of MongoDB Architecture\n",
    "MongoDB environments provide users with a server to create databases with MongoDB. MongoDB stores data as records that are made up of collections and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database:** This is a container for collections like in RDMS wherein it is a container for tables. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A MongoDB server can store multiple databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collections:** This is a grouping of MongoDB documents. Sets of documents are called collections, which function as the equivalent of relational database tables. Collections can contain any type of data, but the restriction is the data in a collection cannot be spread across different databases. Users of MongoDB can create multiple databases with multiple collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documents:** Documents contain the data the user wants to store in the MongoDB database. The documents are similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) but use a variant called Binary JSON (BSON). The benefit of using BSON is that it accommodates more data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "**id:** It is a 24 digit unique identifier to each document in the collection. This is a field required in every MongoDB document. The id field represents a unique value in the MongoDB document. The id field is like the document’s primary key. If you create a new document without an id field, MongoDB will automatically create the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fields:** A name-value pair in a document. A document has zero or more fields.The fields in these documents are like the columns in a relational database. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Values:** Values contained can be a variety of data types, including other documents, arrays and arrays of documents, according to the MongoDB user manual. Documents will also incorporate a primary key as a unique identifier. A document's structure is changed by adding or deleting new or existing fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cursor:** This is a pointer to the result set of a query. Clients can iterate through a cursor to retrieve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mongo Shell:** The mongo shell is a standard component of the open-source distributions of MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users connect the mongo shell to their running MongoDB instances. The mongo shell acts as an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB, which allows users to query or update data and conduct administrative operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSON:** This is known as JavaScript Object Notation. This is a human-readable, plain text format for expressing structured data. JSON is currently supported in many programming languages.\n",

    "## Features of MongoDB\n",
    "An organization might want to use MongoDB for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage:** MongoDB can store large structured and unstructured data volumes. Indexes can be created to improve the performance of searches within MongoDB. Any field in a MongoDB document can be indexed.\n",
    "- **Schema-less:** MongoDB is a schema-less database, which means the database can manage data without the need for a blueprint.The rows (or documents as called in MongoDB) doesn’t need to have a schema defined beforehand. Instead, the fields can be created on the fly.\n",
    "- **Data integration:** This integrates data for applications, including for hybrid and multi-cloud applications.\n",
    "- **Complex data structures descriptions:** Document databases enable the embedding of documents to describe nested structures (a structure within a structure) and can tolerate variations in data.The data model available within MongoDB allows you to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays, and other more complex structures more easily.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** MongoDB supports vertical and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling works by adding more power to an existing machine, while horizontal scaling works by adding more machines to a user's resources.\n",
    "- **Document-oriented:** Since MongoDB is a NoSQL type database, instead of having data in a relational type format, it stores the data in documents. This makes MongoDB very flexible and adaptable to real business world situation and requirements.\n",
    "- **Ad hoc queries:** MongoDB supports searching by field, range queries, and regular expression searches. Queries can be made to return specific fields within documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load balancing** MongoDB uses the concept of sharding to scale horizontally by splitting data across multiple MongoDB instances. MongoDB can run over multiple servers, balancing the load and/or duplicating data to keep the system up and running in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication:** MongoDB can provide high availability with replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more mongo DB instances. Each replica set member may act in the role of the primary or secondary replica at any time. The primary replica is the main server which interacts with the client and performs all the read/write operations. The Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built-in replication. When a primary replica fails, the replica set automatically switches over to the secondary and then it becomes the primary server.\n",

    "- Schema-less.\n",
    "- Document-oriented. \n",
    "- Scalability. \n",

    "- Aggregation. The DBMS also has built-in aggregation capabilities, which lets users run MapReduce code directly on the database rather than running MapReduce on Hadoop. MongoDB also includes its own file system called GridFS, akin to the Hadoop Distributed - File System. The use of the file system is primarily for storing files larger than BSON's size limit of 16 MB per document. These similarities let MongoDB be used instead of Hadoop, though the database software does integrate with Hadoop, Spark and other data processing frameworks.\n",

    "## MongoDB Data Modeling Schema\n",
    "For a given set of data, a schema is essentially a skeleton of fields and data types that each field should contain. All rows should have the same columns, and each column should contain the defined data type, according to SQL. However, MongoDB data modelling comes with a flexible Schema that doesn't require all documents to conform to the same standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Flexible Schema**\n",
    "In MongoDB, a flexible schema specifies that documents do not have to have the same fields or data types, and that a field can vary between documents within a collection. The main benefit of this concept is that it allows you to add new fields, delete existing ones, or change field values to a different type, resulting in a new structure for the document.For example:\n",

    "### MongoDB Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability is the ability of a database to constantly adjust its resources to meet application demands. As an application grows or traffic increases, the original server resources, such as RAM, CPU, storage, and I/O, might not suffice. This is when you will need to scale your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vertical scaling\n",
    "Vertical scaling refers to increasing the processing power of a single server or cluster. Both relational and non-relational databases can scale up, but eventually, there will be a limit in terms of maximum processing power and throughput. Additionally, there are increased costs with scaling up to high-performing hardware, as costs do not scale linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"vs.png\" height=300px width=300px align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Horizontal scaling\n",
    "Horizontal scaling (or scale-out) involves dividing your application data and workload over multiple servers and adding servers to increase capacity. Each machine handles a subset of the overall workload, giving you unlimited scalability. Expanding the capacity of the deployment only requires adding additional servers as needed, which gives you cost linearity compared to vertical scaling. This is difficult with relational databases due to the difficulty in spreading out related data across nodes. With non-relational databases, this is made simpler since collections are self-contained and not coupled relationally. This allows them to be distributed across nodes more simply, as queries do not have to “join” them together across nodes.Scaling MongoDB horizontally is achieved through sharding (preferred) and replica sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hs.png\" height=300px width=300px align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sharding\n",
    "Each node contains a subset of the overall data. This is especially effective for increasing throughput for use cases that involve significant amounts of write operations, as each operation only affects one of the nodes and the partition of data it is managing.While sharding happens automatically in MongoDB Atlas,it is still up to us to configure the shard key, which is used by MongoDB for partitioning the data in a non-overlapping fashion across shards. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sharding.png\" height=400px width=400px align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, datasets typically do not grow uniformly, and various shards will grow at faster rates than others. As your workloads evolve and data sets grow, there will be a need to rebalance data to ensure an even distribution of load across the cluster. This uneven distribution of data is addressed through shard balancing. In MongoDB, this is handled automatically by the sharded cluster balancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Replica Sets\n",
    "Replica sets seem similar to sharding, but they differ in that the dataset is duplicated. Replication allows for high availability, redundancy/failover handling, and decreased bottlenecks on read operations. However, they can also introduce issues for applications with large amounts of write transactions, as each update must be propagated over to every replica set member.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/replica.png\" height=400px width=400px align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load balancing** MongoDB uses the concept of sharding to scale horizontally by splitting data across multiple MongoDB instances. MongoDB can run over multiple servers, balancing the load and/or duplicating data to keep the system up and running in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/2.png\" height=400px width=400px align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication:** MongoDB can provide high availability with replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more mongo DB instances. Each replica set member may act in the role of the primary or secondary replica at any time. The primary replica is the main server which interacts with the client and performs all the read/write operations. The Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built-in replication. When a primary replica fails, the replica set automatically switches over to the secondary and then it becomes the primary server.\n",

    "It depends on your use case! For most applications, you want the ability to do both, as that gives flexibility in meeting the throughput needs of your application. If the needs of your application can be met with a single instance, vertical scaling tends to be the simpler, more straightforward option.\n",
    "\n",
    "For workloads which are more than a single instance can handle, horizontal scaling becomes necessary. Horizontal scaling also supports low latency in globally-distributed applications as well as aids in complying with data-sovereignty requirements. From an administrative and maintenance perspective, horizontal scaling tends to be the more difficult task. Having this feature provided by your database platform can be a huge time-saver."

    "### The MongoDB Backup and Restore\n",
    "The MongoDB Backup and Restore Tool allows you to encapsulate the state of a cluster and return to that state at any time. This helps protect you from data loss, as you can restore a database to a MongoDB instance using a created copy of that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backup Types\n",
    "There are two types of backups in MongoDB: logical backups and physical backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Logical Backups\n",
    "Logical backups dump data from databases into backup files, formatted as a BSON file. During the logical backup process, client APIs are used to get the data from the server. The data is encrypted, serialized, and written as either a “.bson,” “.json,” or “.csv” file, depending on the backup utility used. If you have enabled field level encryption, backing up data will ensure that the field remains encrypted.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supplies two utilities to manage logical backups: **Mongodump and Mongorestore.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mongodump command dumps a backup of the database into the “.bson” format, and this can be restored by providing the logical statements found in the dump file to the databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mongorestore command is used to restore the dump files created by Mongodump. Index creation happens after the data is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical backups copy the data itself. They don’t copy any of the physical files relating to the data (like control files, log files, executables, etc.). They are typically used to archive databases, verify database structures, and move databases across different environments and operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have one server that contains a collection you need in another server, you could use a MongoDB logical backup to migrate the collection from the original server to the target server.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Physical Backups\n",
    "Physical backups are snapshots of the data files in MongoDB at a given point in time. The snapshots can be used to cleanly recover the database, as they include all the data found when the snapshot was created.

    "In today’s digital world, you’re constantly surrounded by data. But in its raw form, it’s hard to get actionable insights from this data. You can imagine how difficult and confusing it can be to interpret rows and rows of numbers. Because of this, you usually use a method called data visualization to present patterns and trends in data more easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, data visualization is the translation of data in a visual way such as a graph, plot, heatmap, or equivalent with the main goal being to make the data easy to digest\n",
